A simple game of 2d balls in the screen, kind of like those quick arcade mobile games. This project was created as a test for [GDAI MCP](https://gdaimcp.com/) & [Ziva](https://ziva.sh/), Creating a data for their AI on how much time it would take without using the plugin. 

This took me 2 hours and 36 minutes
